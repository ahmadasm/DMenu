# DMenu
Dynamic and manageable menu in ASP.NET Core

## Purpose
In web projects, sometimes menus need to be managed dynamically. So I spent a few days and create a system to manage menus. 

## Dependencies
In this system, I used [nestedSortable](https://github.com/ilikenwf/nestedSortable)  jQuery plugin for arrnging items in management page.

## Main page
In this page you can view menus and select them to manage.

## Management page
In this page you could see menu items, add new items and remove items.

## Result 
After editing items of  selected menu, it would be displayed with the same structure at the top navigation bar.
